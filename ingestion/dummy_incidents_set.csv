ID,Category,Incident Description,Mitigation Strategy
1,CAN Bus,"Unauthorized frames detected on the powertrain CAN bus, causing intermittent engine stalling during high-speed travel.",Implement Message Authentication Codes (MAC) and hardware-based IDS to filter unauthorized IDs.
2,OTA Update,"Malicious firmware update bypassed signature verification due to an expired root certificate, leading to infotainment lock.",Update certificate revocation lists and enforce strict hardware security module (HSM) checks.
3,Telematics,"Remote API vulnerability in the mobile app allowed unauthorized doors unlocking and GPS tracking of 5,000 vehicles.",Implement OAuth2.0 with strict scoping and rate-limiting on all telematics API endpoints.
4,Supply Chain,Compromised third-party library in the sensor fusion module introduced a backdoor for remote code execution (RCE).,Perform Software Composition Analysis (SCA) and establish a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM).
5,Infotainment,Browser-based exploit in the head unit allowed lateral movement to the vehicle's internal gateway.,Sandbox the infotainment OS and physically isolate the multimedia bus from critical ECUs.
6,V2X,"Spoofed ""Emergency Electronic Brake Light"" messages caused sudden autonomous braking in multiple nearby vehicles.",Enforce V2X message signing using a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) with low-latency verification.
7,OBD-II,Physical access through the OBD-II port used to inject diagnostic commands that reset the odometer reading.,Disable non-essential diagnostic services when the vehicle is in motion; encrypt ODO storage.
8,EV Charging,Ransomware attack on the EVSE (Charging Station) communication protocol prevented vehicle charging.,Use ISO 15118 secure communication standards with TLS encryption for charging sessions.
9,Keyless Entry,Relay attack captured high-frequency signals from a key fob to gain unauthorized entry and start the vehicle.,Implement Ultra-Wideband (UWB) distance bounding to ensure the key is physically near the car.
10,Diagnostic,Brute-force attack on the UDS (Unified Diagnostic Services) 0x27 Security Access service granted root access to the Body Control Module.,Use asymmetric challenge-response mechanisms and implement lockout timers for failed attempts.
11,Bluetooth,Buffer overflow in the Bluetooth stack allowed an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the infotainment system.,Regularly patch Bluetooth drivers and utilize Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR).
12,Wi-Fi Hotspot,Rogue access point masquerading as the vehicle's default Wi-Fi captured passenger login credentials.,Enforce WPA3 and educate users on verifying hotspot certificates before connecting.
13,Sensor Spoofing,"Ultrasound jammer blinded the ultrasonic parking sensors, causing the ADAS to miss an obstacle.",Implement multi-modal sensor fusion (LiDAR/Camera/Radar) to cross-verify sensor data.
14,Cloud Backend,"Misconfigured S3 bucket exposed 10GB of vehicle telemetry data, including driver behavior and routes.",Enforce the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP) and enable automated cloud configuration auditing.
15,TPMS,Spoofed Tire Pressure Monitoring System signals triggered false low-pressure warnings to distract the driver.,Use encrypted TPMS protocols to prevent external signal fabrication.
16,Gateway,"Denial of Service (DoS) attack flooded the central gateway with high-priority CAN IDs, causing system-wide lag.",Implement traffic shaping and rate-limiting at the central gateway level.
17,Mobile App,Hardcoded API keys in the vehicle's companion Android app were extracted and used to access the owner's account.,Move sensitive keys to a Secure Vault and use runtime application self-protection (RASP).
18,Firmware,Modification of the bootloader allowed an attacker to install a persistent rootkit in the Telematics Control Unit.,Enable Secure Boot with a Hardware Root of Trust to verify firmware at every power cycle.
19,Insider Threat,"Disgruntled employee uploaded a ""logic bomb"" to the production line, bricking ECUs during the final assembly phase.",Implement multi-party authorization for production code changes and monitor for anomalous uploads.
20,GPS Jamming,GPS signal interference caused the vehicle navigation to deviate from the planned route in an autonomous shuttle.,Use dead reckoning (IMU sensors) as a fallback when GPS signal-to-noise ratio is low.
